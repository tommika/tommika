**Gorilla** - Computer Science workouts, in Go!

*Elementary Algorithms and Data Structures*
- Generic binary search tree data structure and algorithms (balanced and unbalanced)
- Generic heap data structure and algorithms, including heap sort and priority queue implementation
- Generic matrix data structure and algorithms
- Generic graph data structure and algorithms
- Generic queue/FIFO abstraction, with multiple implementations: circular array, slice, and linked-list
- and more to come ...

*Utilities*
- Geospatial tools including handling of GPX (GPS Exchange Format) data.
- Processing of XML-formatted data. Well-suited for parsing very large files with minimal memory footprint. Includes a novel declarative event processing mechanism. Lots of good stuff in here related to Go reflection and custom struct tags.
- A powerful declarative model for Go's built-in command-line processing package (flags.) Dramatically simplifies the creation of command-line tools. Makes heavy use of reflection and struct tags.
- and more to come ...
