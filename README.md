About me
--------
In my professional life, as a **Senior Technical Staff Member** (STSM) at **IBM**,
I am recognized as an accomplished Software Engineer, Systems Architect and
Technical Team Leader, with broad software engineering and programming skills,
and a history of delivering high-value software products. I also have a strong
track-record of innovation at **IBM Research**, including major contributions to the
technology that underpins IBM's Cloud, PaaS, SaaS, and middleware products and
strategy (and [20 US patents](./patents.md) and [30 papers/publications](./pubs.md).)

But there's another side to me...<br>

&emsp; **I am a lifetime learner that loves to hack!**<br>

This need to learn (and hack) fuels my professional success. But more
importantly, it drives me to pursue personal projects and explore
technology and skills that are not immediately required for my day job.
